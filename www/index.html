          <h3> About Me </h3>
          <p> I am a passionate developer that believes heavily in open source for the masses. I write clean, efficent code and I am constantly learning a new techonology or perfecting my grasp on a familiar one. I began programming when I was tweleve years old and I haven't looked back since then. While working full time as a software developer for Grooters Productions in Holland, Mi. I am also enrolled in Davenport University currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Computer Engineering. Along with programming I have a strong interest in art and electronics. Currently learning x86 and Raspberry Pi ARM assembly, for some reason. </p>

            <br>
            <p> I started this project to help teach binary. This is a useful and fun way for someone who doesn't quite understand how binary to ascii works. I'm switching out the tactile buttons used for mechanical key switches for an easier experience typing. <br><br> Obviously it is not very practical as a standalone keyboard as typing 8 bits for every one keystroke is tiresome. Blog post and tutorial coming soon, for now here is the gist of the code <a href="https://gist.github.com/leobeosab/5f236958886744f11703a2d3733ddf67" target="_blank"> <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> Gist </a></p>

I worked with many technologies such as PHP, Wordpress, Python, Blender Scripting, Javascript, Ionic, Visual Basic &amp; .NET. Additionally I was responsible for building servers for development and data back up, out of parts I selected and ordered online.
