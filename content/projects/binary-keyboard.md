I started this project to help teach binary. This is a useful and fun way for someone who doesn't quite understand how binary to ascii works. I'm switching out the tactile buttons used for mechanical key switches for an easier experience typing.

Obviously it is not very practical as a standalone keyboard as typing 8 bits for every one keystroke is tiresome. Here is the code if you're interested, I'll have a tutorial soon!
