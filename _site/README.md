# WiseWebDesign

Simple site to house my portfolio site that is currently in development. 


## Tools Used

* Node.JS
* Jekyll
* Sass
* lets-encrypt -- Soon

I will be doing more work on the blog and hopefully getting an admin page with a blog post creator in the coming months. I currently have a lot of other projects so that is put aside for now.

## TODO
1. Update Server and repo to not use Node.js to server static pages. That just doesn't make sense.
