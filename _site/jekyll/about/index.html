<p>I am a strong full-stack and mobile software engineer, currently working at Bravo LT in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I write enterprise Java in my 9 - 5 and I do side projects in any technologies I’m interested in as side projects or with freelance gigs. Not all of my interests include programming. I’m very passionate about cars, motorcycles and motorsports. I enjoy working on projects cars, bikes and competing in race / drift events.</p>
