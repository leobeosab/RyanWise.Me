# RyanWise.Me
My Personal portfolio site for various projects and tomfoolery. Markdown site, best site. 

## Tools Needed
* hugo
* aws-cli ( deployment only )

## Running Locally
```
hugo serve
```

## Building
```
hugo build
```

## Deploying ( with aws cli configured locally )
I'm planning on adding a Github action for deploying this but it's easy enough to just run the following command for now
```
hugo deploy
```

## Theme
Planning on a complete re-work of the theme and site in the coming weeks. 
Theme is hugo-future-imperfect with a few style and page layout changes
