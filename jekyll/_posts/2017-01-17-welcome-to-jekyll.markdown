Hi all!

This is my first blog post with Jekyll for my blog. I hope to add an interface that will let me post and build jekyll without manually
creating a markdown file and running:

`jekyll build --destination ../www/blog`

but for now I will suffer with it.

If you don't know what Jekyll is, it's an awesome static site blog generator built with Ruby and it's open source! Fuck yeah. Here is the link if you're interested.
